# React Medium Feed 🔮

Little demo showing how to create a Medium Feed using React.

## Replicate in other projects

To use this in future projects, just copy the `MediumFeed` component over and use
it.

## Custom Items

It's possible to use a custom component to render the items in the feed. Just
have in mind what attributes are received from the feed. 

The main ones are:

* Title
* Link
* Thumbnail
* Description (sometimes the whole post in html, idk why)

Enjoy! 💁
